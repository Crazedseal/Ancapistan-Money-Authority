# Contributing guidelines
So, you wish to contribute. Fantastic! I appreciate your thought and welcome your contribution.
## Types of contributing
### Bug fix
You noticed a mistake in the code and wish to fix it, awesome. Write up the bugfix and make a Pull Request, I'll look through it and most likely accept, if not I will give a reason
### Feature addition
Now this is finnicky, I will consider these types of pull requests but it's up to the admins of DPS and GMs to decide if they want that in VIR, I'll write up a reason if it's denied, but please understand that I love seeing any and all ideas. :)
## General Requirements
### It runs
I will test whether the code runs, if not, I will deny it. This repo is for a working discord bot.
### Does not leak any test bot token
If you leak a bot token in your pull request, I will deny it and yell at you to remove it, since it violates discords ToS
## Ending
All in all, I welcome all contributions, so please get coding :)
