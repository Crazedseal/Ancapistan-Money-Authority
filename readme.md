# An economy bot for a discord guild called Discord Plays Stellaris 

## THIS BOT IS CURRENTLY BEING PORTED TO C# AND MAY BE MERGED WITH ANOTHER
  
Some of the functions in it are currently disabled due to them being broken or useless, or both.  
This code runs but might be unstable, who knows?  
This uses eris(the discord bot lib), rethinkdbdash(a 3rd party driver for rethinkdb) and express(a web library).  
This might have a webui at some point of time but I am not even sure what to use the webui for.  

## TL;DR of the license.
Do whatever you want with the code, BUT disclose the source and any changes you have done from the original.
